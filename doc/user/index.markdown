# Plotline Usage

## Why use all these tabs, anyway? Can't I just write?

I know what it's like. It's really tempting to skip all the steps in writing a
novel. "I have the most epic climax in mind! I just want to get it on paper!"

Alright, I understand. All writers do. However, I'd highly recommend going
through each aspect of your novel and flesh out exactly how it's going to work
out. This is especially handy if you're writing something with a non-linear
plot or complex storylines.

In fact I'd even recommend using the old pencil-and-paper method before you
even open Plotline! Plotline isn't intended to be a replacement for the work
&hellip; It's only indended to be a digital conversion.

But, assuming you've been a good little writer and done everything correctly,
here's how to use plotline.

## The Overall View

### Novel

For the app's intents and purposes, the project you're working on is called a
**novel** (for obvious reasons).

The first tab in the notebook is used to get (you) the author thinking of what
novel you're going to write. Of course, the title is important, but other
aspects are just as important to think about, such as point of view and tense.

### Characters

Have you ever read a novel only to find you couldn't get emotionally-invested
in characters? One big reason this happens is because authors fail to flesh out
characters--namely, the major characters.

The *Characters* tab provides prompts to develop these deep characters.

### Plotline

For novels that have a non-linear plotline (meaning 2 or more plotlines
involved in the storyline), this view is helpful for getting an idea what will
happen with teach plotline, and which characters are involved.

### Scene

A scene is an event that occurs within a plotline. The scene tab allows you to
specify the headline (a quick description of what's going on) and the action
(a more detailed, step-by-step description of what's going on).

### Chapter

Here you can actually write your novel.
