# Novel Frame

The *Novel Frame* is the place to store overall details on the novel being
written. When [binding a novel](./binding.markdown), Plotline will pull details
from this page. Here is a detailed look at each of the pages for the novel frame.

The components to this frame are based heavily off
[Annie Neugebauer's Novel Plotting Prompts](http://annieneugebauer.com/the-organized-writer-2/novel-plotting-worksheets/).

## Overview

The overview is for the novel title, point of view (POV), and tense. Only the
title will be used when publishing the novel; the POV, tense, and setting will
not be published.

## Author

Information on the author of the novel. While not required, highly recommended.
All this information will be published when the novel is bound and can be added
or omitted as desired.
